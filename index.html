<p>One key website is the official <a href="http://www.usrowing.org">USRowing</a> website. It is a good website because it contains a wealth of information and employs a good use of HTML features. On the downside, it is crowded with information and can be difficult to navigate. It is also not particularly newbie-friendly.</p>
